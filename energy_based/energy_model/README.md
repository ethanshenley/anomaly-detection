# Energy-Based Model for Anomaly Detection

This demo implements an **energy-based model** using PyTorch on the MNIST dataset. The model is a simple MLP that assigns a scalar energy value to each input image. During training, negative samples (random noise) are generated, and a margin-ranking loss is used to enforce that normal samples receive lower energy than negatives. At test time, the energy value itself serves as an anomaly scoreâ€”higher energy indicates that an input may be anomalous.

## Anomaly Detection Use Case

**When to Use an Energy-Based Model:**

- **Unsupervised Learning:**  
  The model is trained solely on normal data and uses an energy score to detect deviations. This is ideal when only normal samples are available.

- **Flexible Objective:**  
  By adjusting the margin, you can control the separation between normal and anomalous samples.

- **Broad Applicability:**  
  Energy-based models have been applied in various domains (e.g., image, audio, sensor data) where anomalies need to be flagged based on reconstruction or deviation from learned patterns.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository** and navigate to the `energy_based/energy_model/` directory.

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Adjust hyperparameters in config.yaml if desired.

4. Run the demo with: `python main.py --config config.yaml`

The script will:

    * Download the MNIST dataset.
    * Train the energy-based model to assign low energy to normal images and higher energy to random negative samples.
    * Evaluate the model on the test set.
    * Plot and save a histogram of energy scores, which can be used as anomaly scores.
